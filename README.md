sticky-bar
==========

A sticky sidebar - or sticky anything...

I always liked it when the sidebar in two column layouts followed the reader when 
the contents of the page scrolled away past it. It always seemed weird to me to have 
the blank space on the side that resulted in being further down the page.

Along came the sticky sidebars. 

I decided to make one myself from scratch and figured it'd be fun to make it easy to 
add to any web page.

Dependencies
------------

JQuery. I have some jquery selectors in the code. I'm confident you can use any version of 
jQuery from 1.3 upwards to the 1.7 I'm probably using at the moment.

Installing it on your own web page
----------------------------------
+ Download the code
+ link the script to your page
+ Configure the couple variables
+ Enjoy the stickiness!
